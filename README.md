## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Andreas

I'm a current student in Computer Science at Aarhus University at bachelor level (2024-2027). 
My interest is very much to understand and explore different parts of Computer Science, and i'll be willing to try and learn about many aspects of Computer Science. 

I'm currently learning/developing my skills in programming with programming exercises.  

I've got a bachelor and master degree in Sports Science and Health from Syddansk universitet. 
Here i've gotten a knowledge about Health metrics, Sports science and Talent development along with working with projects. 
Doing Sports Science i've also learned alot about how to interact with many different people, I've worked with talented youths, sports stars, pre schoolers, parents, and elderly doing my studies. 


These two studies represent many of my interest, and i hope to be able to combine the two. 
In my spare time i like to exercise, game and cook.
